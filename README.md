# face-extractor

Face Extractor is a tool for creating facial datasets from videos. It has two mods:

## Photo Mode:

py face_extract.py -p image.jpg (probably works with all extensions)

## Video Mode:

py facedetect.py -v test.mp4 (only tested in mp4)

# License:

Do whatever the fuck you want to do with it.
